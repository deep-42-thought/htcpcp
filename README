HTCPCP is a protocol for the control of coffee pots over the internet. This is an implementation whipped up in C for the Raspberry Pi. It's been tested with Arch Linux on a model B Revision 1 board, but should work on any board with WiringPi installed. 

To compile:
    make && make install
    
To connect to the server compile the coffee binary and run:
    coffee <host> <port> [Message]
